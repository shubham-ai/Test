**Subject:** Clarification on Model Weights, MLflow Autologging, and Workflow Integration

Hi [Team],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the recent discussions regarding our model management workflow and the integration between the DS and MLE teams, especially now that the backslash issue has been resolved. Below are some key points and questions that need clarification to ensure a smooth process moving forward:

1. **Difference in Model Weights (GitLab vs. MLflow):**  
   In the current GitLab repository, there are two model weights: `model_0_atc.pt` and `model_0_ctcvr.pt`. However, in the model trained by Luyang Wang on MLflow, only one model is registered. Can we clarify the reason behind the difference in the number of models registered in MLflow? Are the two weights from the GitLab repo used for different tasks, and should they be registered separately?

2. **Utils Folder Usage:**  
   Does the `Utils` folder consist of the neural network structure while loading model parameters? Since `mlflow.pytorch.save_model` saves the entire model by default, will we be consuming the `Utils` folder in the future for loading models, or is there an alternate approach being considered?

3. **Consistency of Model Architecture Across Versions:**  
   It has been observed that the models (`model_0_atc.pt`, `model_0_ctcvr.pt`) remain constant across different versions, and we are changing model parameters using the `state_dict` method (`model.load_state_dict(model_pt, strict=False)`). Can we confirm that the architecture (`model_pt`) will remain consistent even as we update parameters across versions?

4. **Managing Model Weights During Autologging:**  
   When autologging the two model weights, I suggest that we manage them either by:
   - Logging them as part of two different experiments and merging them later.
   - Keeping everything as part of a single experiment but organizing them under different runs.

   Which approach would you recommend, given the current structure and future scalability?

5. **Sample Management by DS Team:**  
   We need to determine how the DS team can add samples to experiments for better evaluation and tracking in MLflow. Could we get some input from the DS team on how they plan to log or provide sample data?

6. **Separation of Config/JSON Files:**  
   According to my conversation with Siva, the config files are coming from the DS team. However, there’s still a need for clear separation between what the DS team will log (e.g., model configurations) and what MLE will handle (e.g., deployment configurations). Could we clarify this separation to avoid duplication or confusion?

Please provide your thoughts on the above points at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the workflow and proceed accordingly.

Thanks and best regards,
