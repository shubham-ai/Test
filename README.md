It sounds like you're at a critical phase where you're juggling multiple effortsâ€”working with data scientists, setting up models, addressing real-time integration challenges, and making the system production-ready. Here's a breakdown of your next steps:

1. Model Development & Deployment:

Ajay will guide the team on which models to test next.

Coordinate with the data science team to finalize models and datasets for the Dev and UAT environments.



2. Real-time Integration:

Since you haven't been able to engage the GridVault team, you'll be reaching out to other teams that can collaborate on the real-time process.

Ensure this collaboration moves forward in alignment with the data science team's goals, aiming to improve the real-time aspect of the model.



3. Service Account and Prod Readiness:

You have a meeting with Vamsi to finalize the service account for production, which is essential for smooth deployment.

The focus is on finding a resolution to make this account fully production-ready, allowing the transition from development to production environments.



4. Diagram Creation for Status Update:

A visual representation (diagram) of the current status of the real-time models is needed. This diagram will help communicate progress clearly and serve as a tool to get attraction from the data science team and other stakeholders.

This should cover where the real-time models stand today, potential next steps, and possible enhancements.



5. MLflow Integration:

As you're working towards integrating MLflow as a practice across Verizon's real-time processes, part of the focus will be to show how this can enhance the development cycle and model tracking.




This comprehensive approach should help in moving forward smoothly, both in the development and real-time collaboration aspects. Let me know if you need help structuring any of these points further or creating that diagram.
