**Subject:** Clarification on Model Weights, MLflow Autologging, and Workflow Integration

Hi [Team],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the recent discussions regarding our model management workflow and the integration between the DS and MLE teams, especially now that the backslash issue has been resolved. Below are some key points and questions that need clarification to ensure a smooth process moving forward:

1. **Difference in Model Weights (GitLab vs. MLflow):**  
   In the current GitLab repository, there are two model weights: `model_0_atc.pt` and `model_0_ctcvr.pt`. However, in the model trained by Luyang Wang on MLflow, only one model is registered. Can we clarify the reason behind the difference in the number of models registered in MLflow? Are the two weights from the GitLab repo used for different tasks, and should they be registered separately?

2. **Utils Folder Usage:**  
   Does the `Utils` folder consist of the neural network structure while loading model parameters? Since `mlflow.pytorch.save_model` saves the entire model by default, will we be consuming the `Utils` folder in the future for loading models, or is there an alternate approach being considered?

3. **Consistency of Model Architecture Across Versions:**  
   It has been observed that the models (`model_0_atc.pt`, `model_0_ctcvr.pt`) remain constant across different versions, and we are changing model parameters using the `state_dict` method (`model.load_state_dict(model_pt, strict=False)`). Can we confirm that the architecture (`model_pt`) will remain consistent even as we update parameters across versions?

4. **Managing Model Weights During Autologging:**  
   When autologging the two model weights, I suggest that we manage them either by:
   - Logging them as part of two different experiments and merging them later.
   - Keeping everything as part of a single experiment but organizing them under different runs.

   Which approach would you recommend, given the current structure and future scalability?

5. **Sample Management by DS Team:**  
   We need to determine how the DS team can add samples to experiments for better evaluation and tracking in MLflow. Could we get some input from the DS team on how they plan to log or provide sample data?

6. **Separation of Config/JSON Files:**  
   According to my conversation with Siva, the config files are coming from the DS team. However, there’s still a need for clear separation between what the DS team will log (e.g., model configurations) and what MLE will handle (e.g., deployment configurations). Could we clarify this separation to avoid duplication or confusion?

Please provide your thoughts on the above points at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the workflow and proceed accordingly.

Thanks and best regards,

It sounds like you're at a critical phase where you're juggling multiple efforts—working with data scientists, setting up models, addressing real-time integration challenges, and making the system production-ready. Here's a breakdown of your next steps:

1. Model Development & Deployment:

Ajay will guide the team on which models to test next.

Coordinate with the data science team to finalize models and datasets for the Dev and UAT environments.



2. Real-time Integration:

Since you haven't been able to engage the GridVault team, you'll be reaching out to other teams that can collaborate on the real-time process.

Ensure this collaboration moves forward in alignment with the data science team's goals, aiming to improve the real-time aspect of the model.



3. Service Account and Prod Readiness:

You have a meeting with Vamsi to finalize the service account for production, which is essential for smooth deployment.

The focus is on finding a resolution to make this account fully production-ready, allowing the transition from development to production environments.



4. Diagram Creation for Status Update:

A visual representation (diagram) of the current status of the real-time models is needed. This diagram will help communicate progress clearly and serve as a tool to get attraction from the data science team and other stakeholders.

This should cover where the real-time models stand today, potential next steps, and possible enhancements.



5. MLflow Integration:

As you're working towards integrating MLflow as a practice across Verizon's real-time processes, part of the focus will be to show how this can enhance the development cycle and model tracking.




This comprehensive approach should help in moving forward smoothly, both in the development and real-time collaboration aspects. Let me know if you need help structuring any of these points further or creating that diagram.
