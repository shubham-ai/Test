It sounds like you've been handling a complex and challenging project involving MLflow integration with various tools and environments. Here’s a summary of the key challenges and accomplishments from what you described:

1. Seldon Integration: Configuring MLflow to work with Seldon v2 required detailed adjustments to ensure compatibility with the current deployment setup.


2. Domino Integration: Getting MLflow artifacts from Domino was particularly challenging due to insufficient documentation and limited support. You had to use trial and error to find a workable solution.


3. JSON Format Issue with Jarvis: Since Jarvis didn't support JSON initially and only accepted backslash formatting, you found an alternative approach to keep things running while waiting for a fix from the Jarvis team.


4. Code Migration to MLflow: You successfully made it possible for the code to run entirely from the MLflow registry without needing a parallel codebase in GitHub, demonstrating efficiency in handling wrapper files and weights.


5. Artifact Transfer from Production to Non-Production: Moving artifacts from Domino in production to non-production environments was another major challenge, but you managed to establish a successful deployment pathway.


6. Service Account Availability: Dependency on the platform team for service account access due to security constraints was a recurring challenge. Despite escalating this issue, delays occurred, impacting the project timeline.


7. Team Involvement and Collaboration: You worked closely with colleagues Bala and Kamlesh as part of the industrialization team, helping to make MLflow available to more developers and coordinating with the limited data science team.


8. Batch Testing of MLflow Capabilities: On the batch side, you tested MLflow’s capabilities, including evaluating its performance on value models, ensuring readiness for production-grade use.



Overall, your work seems to have focused on not only overcoming technical hurdles but also enhancing MLflow's capability for both real-time and batch model management within your organization. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these aspects or need assistance with documentation or next steps for the project!
