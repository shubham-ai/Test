Subject: Update on Task Completion, Documentation, and Collaboration

Hi Ajay,

Thank you for taking the time to personally guide me through the grooming process—I truly appreciate your support.

I wanted to update you regarding the task timeline. While the initial delivery deadline was Friday, 10th January, I completed the task by Wednesday, 15th January. Considering non-working days, this means I took an additional buffer of two days.

Additionally, I’d like to emphasize the importance of proper documentation practices, particularly for the feature metric and drift tasks. These documents play a critical role in streamlining processes and will be especially valuable for first-time hands-on tasks like Batch code implementation. By building a solid foundation with documentation, others can navigate these tasks more effectively.

After completing my first run of the code, I feel much more confident and can now execute similar tasks much faster. To ensure the team benefits from this experience, I have created a detailed document for the task and plan to include MLOPP deployment to the PLEUAT environment for broader applicability. I’d like to check if there’s already an existing document for this. If not, I’d be happy to create one for the wider team.

Regarding my availability, I am generally online from 11:30 AM to 7:00 PM. I usually take a lunch break from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM, especially after team calls, and occasionally take short tea breaks. I always notify the team via Slack when I’m stepping away.

Lastly, I plan to shadow Priya with the DS team starting next week. I’ve requested her to keep me in the loop for any discussions with the DS team to help me ramp up. Since I’ve gained more confidence after successfully running my first timer model code upgrade, I’ve also requested Rathore Satyanarayan to add me to relevant groups like vz_india_mle. This will help me connect more directly with the DS team, beginning with the Upgrade model DS team.

Please let me know if there’s anything else I should focus on or address.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
