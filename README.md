Subject: Leave Notification and Request for Documentation

Hi Sathya,

I wanted to inform you that I’m on leave today as I’m unwell and the doctor has advised me to rest due to a high fever.

Regarding the new task of converting the upgrade model from MLOPP to PLEUAT, I wanted to check if there’s any documentation available that could assist me with this.

Additionally, I’d like to update you that the upgrade model stability metric and feature drift analysis are currently on hold due to a data issue. I’ll resume work on them as soon as the issue is resolved.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like any further changes!
